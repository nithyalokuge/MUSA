The piece shows Mary holding her dead son in her arms and across her lap. Part of the arms of Christ and one of His feet are missing. The quality of the modelling in the Pietà suggests that it may be the work of J. J. Kändler, the outstanding Meissen modeller.', 'This Pietà is confirmed to have been made at the famous Meissen porcelain factory around 1732. The factory was established near Dresden, Germany by Frederick-Augustus I, Elector of Saxony, in 1710 after the discovery of how to make hard-paste porcelain, a technique previously only known in Asia. Augustus had a passion for collecting porcelain and was the first European ruler to control the production of true porcelain.\r\n\r\nAlthough made at the Meissen factory in Protestant Saxony, this Pietà is an atypical  Meissen figure sculpture as it is a piece of Catholic Baroque art. Augustus and his heir both converted to Catholicism for political reasons, and records show that the palaces that Augustus had built to house his extensive porcelain collection included a chapel with some Calvary figures similar to this Pietà made for it.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the modelling in the Pietà suggests that it may be the work of J.J. Kandler, the famous Meissen modeller who trained as a sculptor under Benjamin Thomae, court sculptor at Dresden, before coming to Meissen in 1731.\r\n\r\nThe Pietà resembles Thomae\'s Apostle John, modelled for Meissen c. 1719. The sculptor depicts the Mother of God holding the limp body of Christ. Her face is upwards or \"heaven forward\", inviting religious ardour in the faithful.\r\n\r\nJohn Hunt was known to attend antiques auctions and bid on damaged and imperfect goods. Due to the damaged foot on this sculpture, Hunt purchased this Pietà for well under market value.', '1e3b55b9180a4cc0873978c4a45f7e33', 'XKYizvgslNU', '2025-07-14 18:40:05', 1, NULL),

It is a menu card for a cafe called in Catalan \"Els Quatre Gats\" (the Four Cats), depicting a waiter carrying a bottle in one hand and holding a panel inscribed \"Plat del Dia\" (dish of the day) in the other. There is a blank panel below. It is signed P. Ruiz Picasso, the form of his signature used by Picasso until 1901.', 'Pablo Picasso is arguably one of the most influential artists of the twentieth century, but at the time that he made this painting, P. Ruiz Picasso, as he was known by the surnames of both his parents until 1901, when he discarded Ruiz in favour of his mother\'s name alone, was still little known.\r\n\r\nThe famous Four Cats cafe, for which this sketch is a menu card, served as a popular meeting place for avant-garde artists and intellectuals in turn-of-the-century Barcelona. The bohemian environment of the restaurant provided exactly the stimulus that Picasso, then an aspiring artist, was seeking, and he staged his first one-man show in the cafe in 1900.\r\n\r\nThis menu card, designed specifically to promote the dish of the day, or Plat del Dia, the name of which would have been inserted into the large blank space below the image, is light-hearted and animated. A plump waiter, wearing a white apron and a money belt, is shown holding the dish of the day in one hand and a bottle of wine in the other.\r\n\r\nThe caricatural and stylized nature of the sketch, with its emphasized outline and exaggerated features, shows the influence of art nouveau and particularly the poster style, popular at the time and especially associated with Toulouse-Lautrec.\r\n\r\nGertrude Hunt is said to have had this hanging in her kitchen for many years, a reminder that the Hunt Collection was truly lived in, not just a sterile assortment of preserved objects kept out of reach.', '68a17ad581374915adfee31c147642a2', 'XKYizvgslNU', '2025-07-15 16:36:41', 2, NULL),
(3, 'Apollo - Genius of the Arts', 'Artist unknown', '17th century AD', 'First', 'H 119', 'A wooden figure sculpture, possibly representing Apollo in polychrome wood. Apollo, the Classical god of light, poetry, music, healing and prophecy, was often used to represent the trades, arts and professions. Here he is their protector. There is a bird of prey on his shoulder and a lamb by his left foot. He wears a laurel wreath on his head and carries a pomegranate. The figure is naked except for narrow red bands to which are attached the symbols of trades, professions, crafts and artistic pursuits of the many guilds of the time. Decoration is confined to the front of the statue, suggesting that the piece was made to stand in a corner. The feet are not original.', 'This wooden statue shows Apollo, the Greek god of light, poetry, music, healing, and knowledge. It was made in Germany in the 1600s, in the city of Augsburg. Apollo was known as a protector of many trades and professions, and here he is shown with many small objects on his body that represent different kinds of work. On the lower part of his body, we see tools for crafts and manual work. On the upper part, we see things used in science and math. In the middle, we see musical instruments, like drums, a harp, a violin, a tambourine, and bagpipes. Music is important in this sculpture because Augsburg was famous for music and for making instruments.\r\n\r\nIn Apollo\'s right hand, he holds a snake and a pestle. These are symbols of medicine and healing. In his left hand, he holds a pomegranate. This fruit has many seeds inside one skin, and it shows how many different jobs can come together under one protector. The statue only has decoration on the front, which tells us it was probably placed in a corner or alcove, maybe in a guild hall. The feet are not original; they were added later.\r\n\r\nAugsburg was a very rich and important city at the time. It was full of artists, musicians, bankers, and traders. The city\'s wealth came from metalwork, banking, and book printing. The powerful families of the city, like the Fuggers and the Welsers, helped Augsburg grow. There were also many guilds in the city, groups of skilled workers who protected their jobs and made sure work was of high quality. These guilds may have paid for the statue of Apollo to show pride in their trades and to celebrate the city\'s success.\r\n\r\nThe statue also shows Apollo with a crown of laurel leaves. This is a sign of his skill in the arts, especially music. In one famous story, he wins a music contest against a creature named Marsyas, who played the flute. Apollo\'s body here is decorated in a very detailed and realistic way. This style of art was popular in Northern Europe at the time and is called \"genre art\". It often showed people at work or in everyday life. This statue fits that style, showing real tools and objects from different jobs instead of just a myth.\r\n\r\nThe Apollo statue is a beautiful example of how art, work, and pride in a city all came together in one object. Even though some of its colors are gone now, we can still see how important this figure was to the people of Augsburg.\r\nFun fact: The entire statue (except for the bird and the feet) was carved from one solid piece of wood! The sheep at his feet isn\'t part of any myth; it was probably added just to help the statue stand up straight!', '1d20261414d44f6797467851235600a0', 'XKYizvgslNU', '2025-07-15 16:42:24', 1, NULL),

The front face shows a female head surrounded by four dolphins, possibly Arethusa or Persephone. The reverse shows a chariot pulled by four horses and a charioteer. The goddess of victory, Nike, flies overhead to crown the charioteer\'s head with a wreath. This coin is reputed to be one of the so-called thirty pieces of silver paid to Judas for betraying Christ. This belief comes from the Middle Ages. The gold band surrounding the coin is inscribed with: \"Quia precium sanguinis est\" [This is the price of blood]. The coin is Greek, Sicilian, or Southern Italian; the mint is medieval.', 'The Ancient Greek city of Syracuse was famous for making some of the best coins in history. This ten-drachma coin was special. It was made to celebrate a Syracusan victory, either against the Athenians in 413 B.C. or the Carthaginians in 405 B.C.\r\n\r\nOn the front of the coin, there is a picture of a chariot pulled by fast-running horses. A person is putting a wreath on the head of the chariot driver to show victory. In the late 5th century B.C., the design changed to make the horses look like they were moving. This design shows the power of rich people in Syracuse, because chariot racing was a sport for the rich. Gelon, the ruler of Syracuse, even won a race at the Olympic Games in 484 B.C. The armor under the chariot, a helmet, greaves (leg guards), and cuirass (body armor),  shows that this was a military victory.\r\n\r\nOn the back of the coin, there is a picture of the nymph Arethusa, who was the goddess of a spring in Syracuse. She is shown with dolphins swimming around her.\r\n\r\nThe coin is in a frame, probably from the Middle Ages. The frame has a quote from the Bible: \"Quia precium sanguinis est\", which is Latin for \"Because it is the price of blood.\" People believed this coin was one of the 30 silver coins paid to Judas for betraying Jesus.\r\n\r\nThat story is not true, but the idea gave the coin religious importance. Because of this, many people took care of the coin for hundreds of years, leading to its preservation.\r\n\r\nThe story goes that this coin was once found in a bowl of old coins in a shop that sold antiques and strange items. John Hunt, who liked finding good deals, didn\'t want the shop owner to know it was valuable. So, instead of choosing just this coin, he asked to buy the whole bowl for a low price, pretending that none of the coins were special.', NULL, 'XKYizvgslNU', '2025-07-15 16:42:24', NULL, NULL),

Yeats was the son of the portrait artist John Butler Yeats and the brother of the famous poet William Butler Yeats. He was born in London and studied art there. He also worked in London and Devon in the early part of his life. But Jack Yeats saw himself as a creator of a new kind of Irish art.\r\n\r\nSligo, a place where both Jack and William spent much of their youth, was very important in their work. Jack\'s early paintings, which consisted mainly of watercolors and oil paintings, had strong outlines and often used symbols. Later, his style changed. He began to paint in a more free and expressive way, using rough brushstrokes and bright, separate colors. This new style brought him international fame. In 1924, artist Walter Sickert wrote to Yeats, saying his work showed that modern painting was possible: \"Life above everything.\"\r\n\r\nIn the painting \"An Atlantic Drive\", you can see travelers in a sidecar, with the wide Atlantic Ocean behind them, painted in bold blue strokes. The scene is from Mullaghmore in County Sligo, a place Yeats often visited. This painting was first shown in Limerick at the Goodwin Galleries in March 1944, and later at a large Yeats exhibition in Dublin in 1945.\r\n\r\nDid you know that the early modern Olympic Games included art competitions? From 1912 to 1948, artists competed in five categories: architecture, literature, music, painting, and sculpture. Each work had to be inspired by sport.\r\n\r\nIn 1924, Jack B. Yeats won a silver medal in painting at the Olympics for his artwork \"The Liffey Swim\".', 'dddb6e64aaa5421f8d01cee3dc2946a3', 'XKYizvgslNU', '2025-07-15 16:42:24', 2, NULL),

Only the inside of the dish is shiny, and the painting is done in a pale green-blue color.\r\n\r\nIn the 13th century, dishes like this were sometimes used as shop signs and placed into the walls of buildings. Some still remain today in the walls of old churches in Italy and Spain. On the back and edge of this dish, there is old lime mortar, showing that it was once set into a wall.\r\n\r\nWhen this dish was first collected, people called it the \"Picasso Dish\", even though it was made almost 700 years before Picasso was born.

After that, he studied at the Royal Hibernian Academy with the artist Walter Osborne. In 1903, Leech moved to Paris to study at the Académie Julian. There, he fell in love with the French countryside and began painting in a bright, light-filled style influenced by French Impressionism.\r\n\r\nEven though he lived mostly outside Ireland, Leech stayed connected to his home country. He often showed his work with other Irish artists like Jack B. Yeats and Constance Markievicz.\r\n\r\nLeech painted the portrait Suzanne Botterell in 1920. It was ordered by Percy Dumville Botterell, a lawyer in London. His wife, May Botterell, had helped prisoners of war during World War I. One of those prisoners was Leech\'s brother, Lieutenant Colonel Cecil Leech. He introduced the two families.\r\n\r\nThe painting shows Percy and May\'s young daughter, Suzanne. The portrait is soft and gentle, with a calm feeling. Leech was very good at painting light and emotion. In the background is a cherry blossom tree, painted in a way that looks like Japanese art. Leech even signed his name in a vertical line, like in traditional Japanese painting.\r\n\r\nAfter this painting, Leech stayed close to the Botterell family.

She is shown à la Grecque, a style fashionable on the continent, especially in Paris. The painting is framed.', 'Robert Fagan was born in London in 1761. His father was an Irish baker. Even though Robert never visited Ireland, he thought of himself as Irish. He even painted a patriotic picture of a woman named Margaret Simpson as Hibernia, a symbol of Ireland.\r\n\r\nFagan studied at the Royal Academy School. After school, he traveled to Italy. He arrived in Rome in 1784 and lived there for most of his life. He became well known for painting portraits of people visiting Italy. He also worked as an art dealer and an archaeologist. In 1809, he became the Consul General of Sicily and Malta.\r\n\r\nOne of his paintings is called The Artist and His Wife. It shows Fagan with his second wife, Maria Ludovica Flajani. They got married in 1801. In the painting, Maria is shown in a style called à la grecque, which means she is topless. This was a popular style at the time, especially in Paris. It was meant to look like clothing from ancient Greece, which people admired for its ideas about democracy.\r\n\r\nIn 1815, Fagan went back to England to paint murals for a man named Lord Berwick. But the next year, when he was returning to Italy, he became sick and had money problems. Sadly, in 1816, he died by suicide.', 'ed6a0a9b2bef45d795a5de1482bcd89d', 'XKYizvgslNU', '2025-07-19 09:03:57', 2, NULL),

It is by far the most interesting and is a marvelous example of an allegorical painting.', '\"Night\'s Candles are Burnt Out\" is a painting by Irish artist Seán Keating. It shows a big change happening in Ireland after the country became independent. The painting was made at the Ardnacrusha power station, which was a huge building project on the River Shannon. At the time, it was the biggest hydroelectric dam in the world, and it brought electricity to Irish homes and businesses.\r\n\r\nKeating was born near the area, in Limerick. He once said the land before the dam was like a \"medieval dungheap\", but now it was becoming modern. He thought the dam was a symbol of Ireland\'s future and progress.\r\n\r\nIn the painting, you can see many people. On the left, Keating painted himself holding a lamp to light up a skeleton. This shows Ireland\'s hard past, with war, hunger, and slow change. In the middle, a man in a suit (a businessman) stands next to a man from the IRA. This shows the fight between modern ideas and old political struggles.\r\n\r\nA priest is also in the painting, reading by candlelight. Some priests at the time did not agree with the money spent on the dam. They thought it should go to helping poor people instead. On the right, Keating paints himself again with his wife and sons. They are pointing at the dam, showing hope for a better future.\r\n\r\nWhen people first saw the painting, they didn\'t know what to think. Some said it was \"the problem painting of the year\" because it showed so many different ideas: war, peace, religion, machines, and family. But Keating found these comments funny. He had changed as an artist and now wanted to paint modern Ireland.\r\n\r\nToday, the Ardnacrusha dam still works and provides clean electricity. It was finished in 1929 and still produces about 86 megawatts of power, enough to power thousands of homes.', '32115b86f48049f69ea29988a690f1be', 'XKYizvgslNU', '2025-07-19 09:25:53', 2, '/hunt/games/puzzle'),

They shared a love of art, history and design.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, he began buying and selling works of art.\r\n\r\nHe worked with international museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and well-known antique shops and dealerships such as Christie\'s and Sotheby\'s.\r\n\r\nIn 1934, John and Gertrude opened an antique shop and gallery on Bury Street, London, where they developed an international reputation for medieval art.\r\n\r\nThroughout the 1930s, John and Gertrude travelled across Europe collecting objects from antique shops, churches, art museums and other collectors.\r\n\r\nOver the years, they retained items to which they were particularly attached, keeping them in their home and using many on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nTheir personal collection was both wide-ranging and diverse, and this is reflected in the variety of items forming the Hunt Collection.\r\n\r\nJohn and Gertrude moved to Ireland following the outbreak of  World War II and lived initially at Lough Gur in County Limerick.\r\n\r\nJohn became a keen and informed archaeologist and worked on many excavations, including the important site at Lugh Gur.\r\n\r\nThe Hunts believed in the importance of providing opportunities for the young to experience and appreciate art and history.\r\n\r\nTheir collection, which forms the heart of this Museum, is now owned by the Hunt Museums Trust, established in 1974.', NULL, 'DIAtALIDQR0', '2025-07-19 12:12:26', NULL, NULL),

(at base) 20.3\r\nMitre: H 200.8', 'The O Dea Crozier and Mitre are on display in the Museum on behalf of the Roman Catholic diocese of Limerick. They were made to the order of Bishop Conor O Dea of Limerick in 1418 and still belongs to his successor. The crozier is of the usual medieval continental form based on the crook of a shepherd and is the only native example of this type known in Ireland. It is made up of a staff and the decorated head bearing the crook. This mitre made by Thomas O Carryd would have been used for the most solemn occasions.', 'These two remarkable objects, a bishop\'s crozier and mitre, were commissioned in 1418 by Bishop Cornelius O\'Dea, the first bishop appointed to the newly formed Roman Catholic Diocese of Limerick. Together, they are among the most important surviving examples of late medieval Irish church regalia.\r\n\r\nThe crozier, measuring over 7.5 feet tall and weighing nearly 10 pounds, is both physically impressive and symbolically powerful. Traditionally carried by bishops, the crozier\'s curved shape is based on the shape of a shepherd\'s crook. This particular crozier is especially rare because it is the only known Irish example of the continental open-crook style, more common across Europe than in Ireland. Crafted from wood and decorated with silver, it features delicate chasings, crown motifs, and sculptural details that speak to the artistry of 15th-century Irish metalworkers. A Latin inscription around the base reads: \"Cornelius O\'Dea, Bishop of Limerick, caused me to be made in the year of our Lord 1418.\"\r\n\r\nThe crook itself contains a highly detailed religious tableau. At the centre is the Virgin Mary, seated beneath a dove, which is the symbol of the Holy Spirit. She is flanked by the Archangel Gabriel and a lily rising from a jug, symbols of the Annunciation, the moment Mary learns she will bear Christ. Beneath this grouping is a carving of a pelican feeding her young, a medieval symbol of sacrifice used to represent Christ\'s suffering. Further down the shaft, within finely carved canopied niches, are depictions of revered religious figures, including Saints Brigid, Catherine, Margaret, Patrick, Peter, Paul, and the Virgin Mary, as well as representations of the Trinity. The level of intricacy and devotion in these details illustrates both the spiritual purpose and the artistic sophistication of the piece.\r\n\r\nThe mitre, the ceremonial pointed hat worn by bishops, was made to accompany the crozier and is equally detailed. Constructed from silver gilt laminae, thin layers of silver covered with gold,  it is adorned with large pearls, gemstones, and ornate panels decorated with curling vine leaves and Gothic mouldings. Near the top, two Latin inscriptions are set beneath crystal: \"Hoc signum crucis erit in coelo\" (\"This sign of the cross shall appear in heaven\") and \"Cum Dominus ad judicandum venerit\" (\"When the Lord comes to judge\"). These texts would have served as powerful reminders of divine judgment and heavenly authority. At the base, an enamelled inscription identifies the maker as Thomas O\'Carrys, described as \"artifex faciens\", meaning \"the artist who made this\", linking the object to the remarkable craftsmanship flourishing in Dublin around that time.\r\n\r\nAdding to the wonder surrounding these objects is a beloved legend. According to the story, Bishop O\'Dea once arrived in Dublin for a meeting of bishops without his pontifical vestments. As he searched the city for replacements, a mysterious young man appeared from a ship and handed him a box containing a crozier and mitre. When O\'Dea turned to thank him, the youth had vanished. The bishop and many others believed the items had been divinely delivered. While we can\'t confirm the miracle, it\'s true that both the crozier and mitre are believed to have been crafted in Dublin around the same time, giving the legend a touch of historical credibility.\r\n\r\nToday, both objects are on loan from the Roman Catholic Diocese of Limerick, where they are still occasionally used during special liturgical ceremonies. They were most recently used by Bishops Butler and O\'Dwyer. Their survival and continued use reflect not just the durability of their materials, but also the enduring legacy of faith and artistry in Ireland\'s religious history.\r\n\r\nFun fact: For centuries, the crozier and mitre were kept locked in a special chest in Limerick Cathedral and brought out only for the most solemn occasions. Seeing them on display today offers a rare chance to experience the beauty, mystery, and devotional power of Ireland\'s medieval past up close.', 'e81aa36da4324065b628ef5da5599d5a', 'XKYizvgslNU', '2025-07-20 09:50:36', NULL, NULL);
